Accelerated urbanisation has led to increasing population densities in cities around the world. As population density rises, crime has become a growing concern for all sectors of society. Understanding the relationship between population density and crime incidents is important for the development of effective urban planning and public safety strategies.<br>

Numerous studies have shown that there is a complex correlation between population density and the number of crime incidents. High population density areas are usually accompanied by higher crime rates, especially in terms of both violent crime and property crime.<br>

Social disorganisation theory suggests that high population densities may lead to a weakening of social control and increase the probability of crime. Routine activity theories, on the other hand, emphasise that crime is part of everyday activities and that high population densities imply a greater number of potential victims, thus increasing crime rates.<br>

Although there has been a significant amount of research on the relationship between population density and crime rates, there is still less research specific to the particular context of Leeds. The aim of this study is to reveal the relationship between population density and the amount of crime in Leeds through data analysis and to explore other relevant factors that influence this relationship.<br>

Through this study, we hope to provide valuable data to support city managers and stakeholders, thereby improving the science of crime prevention.<br>

A large number of studies have explored the relationship between population density and crime rates. Overall, these studies suggest that high population density areas tend to be accompanied by higher crime rates. According to Malleson and Andresen (2015), analysis using social media data showed that the spatial distribution of crime hotspots in Leeds city centre changed significantly when mobile populations were taken into account (Malleson & Andresen, 2015). This data on the mobile population provides a higher spatial and temporal resolution than the resident population, helping to predict crime hotspot areas more accurately.<br>

Nolan (2004) noted that there is a statistical relationship between crime rates and population size and that population size has a significant effect on crime rates in jurisdictions of different sizes (Nolan, 2004). In contrast, Hipp and Roussell (2013) suggested that both micro-population density and macro-population density have a significant effect on crime rates, particularly in the case of stranger crime (e.g., robbery and motor vehicle theft), with macro-social processes having a greater impact (Hipp & Roussell, 2013).<br>

Furthermore, Lawal Gulma et al. (2018) emphasised the importance of community cohesion by examining the relationship between diversity and burglary in Leeds, finding that community diversity significantly affects crime rates (Gulma et al., 2018).<br>

Many studies have explored the relationship between population density and different types of crime through correlation analyses.Christens and Speer (2005) found that population density was negatively correlated with violent crime in urban centres but positively correlated in suburban areas (Christens & Speer, 2005). In addition, Toomey et al. (2012) examined the relationship between the density of alcohol outlets and violent crime and found that the density of alcohol outlets was positively associated with all types of violent crime (Toomey et al., 2012).<br>

Using a more sophisticated analytical approach, Rotolo and Tittle (2006) found a non-linear relationship between population size and crime rates, a finding that challenges traditional criminological perspectives (Rotolo & Tittle, 2006).<br>

In terms of research techniques, the use of Python and k-means cluster analysis techniques is becoming increasingly common.Algahtany and Kumar (2016) provided a methodology for studying crime patterns using remote sensing techniques by using satellite imagery to measure urban sprawl and testing its correlation with criminal activity (Algahtany & Kumar, 2016).<br>

Furthermore, Ambrose et al. (2017) used machine learning techniques to analyse crime data and identify crime hotspot areas through cluster analysis (Ambrose et al., 2017). This approach provides a new perspective to help identify and predict potential high crime areas, enhancing the effectiveness of public safety management.<br>

In summary, there is a complex relationship between population density and crime rates, and different types of crime respond differently to population density. Data analysis using techniques such as Python and k-means can provide strong support for crime prevention. Future research can further incorporate more environmental variables to improve the predictive power of the model.<br>

The GitHub repository contains population density data and crime record data for Leeds in 2022. The crime data contains crime category and date data. Both data contain LSOA code so can be linked. The GitHub repository also contains .ipynb notebook which contains the code used in the analysis and associated textual explanations. It also contains geo-grid data for the city of Leeds, which is used for geo-visualisation.<br>

The research aim of the code was to analyse the relationship between population density and crime incidents in the city of Leeds. Statistical analysis of data on different types of crime and population density data was used to investigate whether the incidence of various types of crime in different areas is related to the population density of the area. Details are provided below:
By examining the correlation between population density and crime types, it is possible to understand the distribution of various crime types in areas with different population densities and also to determine which types of offences are more frequent in areas with higher and lower population densities. Crime prediction models using linear regression, non-linear regression (e.g., polynomial regression), and random forest regression methods to assess the accuracy of these models in predicting different crime types. Spatial visualisation of crime data using GIS and cluster analysis to show the geographical distribution of high and low crime areas. Visualisation of the relationship between population density and the number of crimes by means of heat maps and scatter plots.<br>

In summary, there is indeed a relationship between population density and the amount of crime, especially for certain types of crime, where the amount of crime increases significantly as population density increases. However, this relationship is not entirely consistent or linear, and the degree of correlation and impact varies for different types of crime. Overall: The types of crime for which there is a clear relationship: violent and sexual offences, burglary, robbery, vehicle crime and drug offences are more common in high population density areas. Types of crime with an insignificant relationship: shoplifting, public order offences, etc. do not have a significant relationship with population density, suggesting that these offences may be more influenced by other factors.
